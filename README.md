# React-Native-ToDo-List-Mobile-App
Cross platform Android and IOS app written in react-native

A demo to-do list mobile app that I created for a education company named Graspie. Written in React-Native.
Mainly javascript and css style written code.
Used Firebase as realtime backend (NoSQL database) for live updates across devices when a task was added.
For security reasons, in the App.js file (which acts as the main function) I replaced the config information to my database 
with 'xxxxx'.

To get full functionality you can easily create your own firebase realtime database for free and add your credential information in place of it and it will run fine.

Potential Employers if wanted I can send .apk file personally.
Any questions feel free to ask!
